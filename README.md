# Covid-19-Spain-data-analysis
Infectious Disease Modeling of the COVID-19 Pandemic using Compartmental Models (Spain data)
•	Developed and simulated a series of mathematical models to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic trajectory of Spain real-world data from the ECDC.
•	Estimated the time-varying effective reproduction number (Rt) using the Cori et al. methodology to quantify real-time changes in transmission.
•	Built and calibrated a baseline SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed) model, then advanced it to conduct scenario analysis, evaluating the impact of social distancing measures on the epidemic curve.
•	Enhanced model realism by incorporating population heterogeneity, developing an age-structured model based on a social contact matrix to simulate transmission across different age groups.
•	Implemented advanced models to identify unknown changepoints in the transmission rate, providing data-driven insights into the timeline of intervention effectiveness.
Key Skills: Infectious Disease Modeling, SEIR Models, Age-Structured Modeling, Parameter Estimation (Rt), Scenario Analysis, Changepoint Detection, Simulation, R Programming.
